# Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock Game

Link to the site! [Pblished site](https://www.youtube.com/).

## Introduction

I've created a game that allows users to enjoy a classic from the show "Big Bang Theory." This game includes all the iconic options from the series, allowing you to play against a computer, set your name, view your score, and reset if the computer is winning too much! The aim was to deliver snappy gameplay and simplicity to the user.
